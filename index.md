#### Elevator project : The function of my project is a working elevator for three floors. How it works is that my first circuit takes each switch and converts it into a separate floor. What it does is that when a switch is turned on it canâ€™t turn on another floor until you turn all the switches off. WIth a 4th switch included is the emergency switch which is a stop function which acts as a shut off system. Now that I have these four inputs I take them into my second circuit which then converts those signals into an actual movement on the motor. This is done by the use of copper tape. This method lets it know which floor it is currently on and when it makes the decision to move down or but depending on which floor. If you want to go down you turn on a switch which then takes you downwards as you click which floor you would like to go to. Finally it outputs from the first 4 inputs which is a movement to any floor. The way it stops is that between each floor I created a gap between the copper tape. This creates a lack of signal towards the gates which then turns it off.
